How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because it compares line for line the changes done in the file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because you can retrieve all the versions of the file that have been created

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros you are not creating a lots of copies of the same file
    cons you will have to decide if the change is too small, too big, or if it has the correct size to be saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because when you are coding your will most likely to modify different files that are related to one feature. So you want to show another programmers that all the changes where made to provide only one feature.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git diff you can look for revisions and git diff used to compare

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You always can make a Branch and keep your on version of the application.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will try it in a merge branch situation
